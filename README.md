# number-guessing-game
We are creating a simple number guessing game through java program in which the user will have to guess a randomly generated number.

The number is in the range of 1 to 100.

If the user guesses a number that is greater, we print “The number is too large”.
If the user guesses a number that is smaller, we print “The number is too small”.
If the user is able to correctly guess the number, then we print “Correct Number!”.

At the end we will print the number that was generated by our Math library.

LET THE GUESSING BEGIN :)
